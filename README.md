#  React SSR Loadable Components Boilerplate

I thought of putting this code in a repo because of the struggles I had to face while trying to build a similar solution for a project in my company. For someone that may find themselves in a similar situation, I hope this project helps them to bootstrap [React using SSR](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) with [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/) in little to no time :grinning:.

## Motivation
Implement **Code Splitting** in **React** using **Loadable Components** specially when you are doing **Server Side Rendering**.

## Challenges
While the official documentation of Loadable Components try to make it **sound easy** to implement code splitting using their library after you follow the steps given at https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/, the reality could be a little different :disappointed_relieved:. There are a lot of nuances that you'll come across once you start implementing the steps specially coming to terms with some of the keywords like **node stats**, **web stats** and which one is really needed over the other. Some of the terms are obviously not clear and **[one very important step](/README.md#configure-react-scripts-to-use-the-loadable-babel-and-webpack-plugins-which-enables-naming-the-chunks-and-enabling-code-splitting-respectively)**(the most crucial one tbh and one which I didn't find nowhere :sob: and had to discover after a lot of experimentation), is **missing** in their documentation or rather they should have done a better job of calling it out because what Loadable Components does for you is great otherwise.

## What this repo can do for you
- Save you from days worth of time figuring out some missing but obvious things while trying to implement **Code Splitting** using [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/) and **SSR**.
- Provide you with some crucial code that you can plugin **AS IS** in your existing app to make it work.

## Prerequisites

### The following 3 libraries are ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS in the context of this code for all of this to work,
1. [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/)
2. [Customize CRA](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra)
3. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## App Structure
<img width="296" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 7 49 36 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34688999/131269371-b843e4ed-0ef6-41ef-8f5a-3f74a4ccd525.png">

## Important Files
| File Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| src/index.tsx  | Renders/Hydrates the app on the browser  |
| src/App.tsx  | Uses React Router to load and match 2 routes; **/** matching to `home-page.tsx` and **/loadable-page** matching to `loadable-page.tsx` respectively while **dynamically importing** them both  |
| config-overrides.js  | Used by **customize-cra** to apply your custom webpack configuration before react-script's configuration takes over. customize-cra works with **react-app-rewired** to run most of react scripts  |
| webpack-config.js  | Custom webpack configuration to bundle the code before it can be used server side with Express.  |
| server/index.js  | Entry Point for the custom webpack configuration above to start the Express Instance and server React App Server Side.  |

## Important Code Blocks

### [config-overrides.js](/config-overrides.js)

#### Configure React Scripts to use the Loadable Babel and Webpack Plugins which enables naming the chunks and enabling Code Splitting respectively
```
const { override, addWebpackPlugin, addBabelPlugin } = require("customize-cra");
const LoadablePlugin = require("@loadable/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = override(
  addBabelPlugin("@loadable/babel-plugin"),
  addWebpackPlugin(new LoadablePlugin())
);
```

### [webpack.config.js](/webpack.config.js)

#### [Line 20](https://github.com/dherenj84/react-ssr-loadable/blob/e14763119430ae0c385e49aa43aead33e9942b26/webpack.config.js#L20); Configure Loadable Babel Plugin which enables naming the chunks by a logical name
```
plugins: ["@loadable/babel-plugin"],
```

#### [Line 50](https://github.com/dherenj84/react-ssr-loadable/blob/e14763119430ae0c385e49aa43aead33e9942b26/webpack.config.js#L50); Configure Loadable Webpack Plugin so that Code Splitting can work
```
plugins: [new LoadablePlugin()],
```

### [server/index.js](/server/index.js)

#### When you'll run `npm run build` which looks like this `"build": "rimraf build && react-app-rewired build && npx webpack"`, because of the config-overrides, the `react-scripts` are going to generate a file called `loadable-stats.json` right under the build folder and `webpack` command is going to generate a similar file but under build/server directory. As my comments in the following code also emphasize, use the file under build folder which is also referred to as the **web stats** during the chunk extraction process.
```
// This is the stats file generated by webpack loadable plugin.
  // It's very important that you use the web stats instead of node stats,
  // so use /build/loadable-stats.json instead of /build/server/loadable-stats.json
  const statsFile = path.resolve("./build/loadable-stats.json");

  // We create an extractor from the statsFile
  const extractor = new ChunkExtractor({ statsFile });

  // Wrap your application using "collectChunks"
  const jsx = extractor.collectChunks(
    <StaticRouter location={req.url}>
      <App />
    </StaticRouter>
  );

  // Render your application
  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(jsx);

  // You can also collect your "preload/prefetch" links
  const linkTags = extractor.getLinkTags(); // or extractor.getLinkElements();
  // console.log(linkTags);

  // And you can even collect your style tags (if you use "mini-css-extract-plugin")
  const styleTags = extractor.getStyleTags(); // or extractor.getStyleElements();
  // console.log(styleTags);

  // You can now collect your script tags
  const scriptTags = extractor.getScriptTags().replace(/async /g, ""); // or extractor.getScriptElements();
    const indexFile = path.resolve("./build/index.html");

  fs.readFile(indexFile, "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error("Something went wrong:", err);
      return res.status(500).send("Oops, better luck next time!");
    }
    return res.send(
      data
        .replace('<div id="root"></div>', `<div id="root">${html}</div>`)
        .replace(
          '<script>console.log("loadable tags placeholder")</script>',
          `${linkTags}\n${styleTags}\n${scriptTags}`
        )
    );
  });
```

## How to run
1. Run `npm run build` which triggers react-scripts first to create static assets and then triggers webpack cli to bundle the code so that it can be run server side.
2. Run `npm run start-ssr` which internally loads the bundle created by Step 1 above and starts the Express instance.

## What you should expect to see

### build directory with the following code

### customize-cra/react-app-rewired generating the following named chunks for you

### webpack cli generating the following chunks; you can see that internally it maps the numbered chunks to logical names on the right

Checkout how the chunks will be loaded on demand while SSR would still work if you reload a route. **Happy Coding** :v:
